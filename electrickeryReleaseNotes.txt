- Forked from https://github.com/petrohi/terminal
- Modified the new_line_mode option to support three values: off, AUTOCR and AUTOLF. 
  This means the bool is changed to an enum.
- Changed the behaviour of the receive_cr method so it can insert a linefeed when new_line_mode == AUTOLF.
- Changed the behaviour of the receive_lf method so it works woth the enum.
- Here I got lucky, as the Save functionality still worked, and the SETUP pages us another mechanisn to display text.
- For this testing period the PRODUCT_VERSION number is 3.2.electrickery. (terminal.c)
- When AUTOCR or AUTOLF is active, the startup message in the PRODUCT_COPYRIGHT is printed with extra lines.
